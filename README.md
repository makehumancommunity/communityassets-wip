# Community Assets: Work in Progress

This repo is for work in progress assets, including source blends and similar

## License

EVERYTHING SUBMITTED HERE IS ASSUMED TO BE LICENSED CC0. BY MAKING A COMMIT YOU SHARE YOUR WORK UNDER CC0.

This applies to everything which isn't AGPL in its nature, for example the base mesh as imported by makeclothes or maketarget.

## Getting commit access

If you want to send things here, either ask me for commit access or make a pull request. If you want commit access, I need to know your github ID. 

## What to submit

You should send everything that's required for working with the asset in question. In most cases this is probably a .blend file, textures and so on. 

## What to not submit

This repo is intended for collaborative work. If all you want to do is share something, but you're not really interested in getting help from others with it, then don't put it here. Just upload it to the forums or to the normal repo instead.

There is a size limit on github repos, so don't include files which are unnecessary for the asset. In particular, try to keep the size of the .blend file down (for example, do not pack textures inside the blend, add them separately).

## In case of conflict

This is a general scratch pad and things put here are not final versions. If you don't like a commit someone did, either simply improve or revoke it, or make a separate version of the asset.
